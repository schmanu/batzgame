# batzgame
Batzgame is a textbased adventure game for our good friend lobatz as a birthday present.

Feel free to use my self-written framework for your own textbased adventure games.
Everybody is also invited to check-out this repo and play my current game. If you do so please give me feedback.
Sorry for all non-German Speakers... as the game is completely in German.

Don't judge my possibly bad code-style. This is my first python program ever and its a really quick hack.
